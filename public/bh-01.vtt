00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:07.020
Political and economic crises have
placed energy security front and centre.

2
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:11.580
And as new energy transition scenarios are
unfolding, they've forced us to question

3
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.340
basic assumptions about how
the energy transition will play out.

4
00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:17.700
Can we really get to net zero while also

5
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.580
maintaining energy security
and affordability?

6
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.420
We surveyed 500 senior executives
in energy and hard-to-abate industries

7
00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:30.180
to find out how they are tackling this
energy trilemma to balance energy security

8
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.740
and access to sustainable energy,
respondents say their top priority is

9
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.500
to invest in lower-carbon sources
of energy, including natural gas.

10
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.540
57 per cent say they plan to make new investments
in natural gas, or LNG,

11
00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.460
and 30 per cent say they plan to make new
investments in hydrogen in the future.

12
00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:55.060
But existing technology is not enough
to get us to net zero by 2050.

13
00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.940
Without major investment,

14
00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.420
innovation and collaboration,
we can't achieve net zero by 2050.

Read the Baker Hughes Energy Transition Pulse

16
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:09.820
to find out how energy and industry
can tackle the energy trilemma â€”

17
00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.560
balancing energy security,
sustainability and affordability.
